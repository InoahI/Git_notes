## Introduction

Git is a powerful version control system that helps you manage your codebase, track changes, and collaborate with other developers. Whether you're working on a personal project or contributing to open-source software, Git is an essential tool for modern software development.

## Getting Started

### Installing Git

Before you begin, you need to install Git on your computer. You can download Git from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Configuration

After installing Git, you should configure your username and email address. Open a terminal and run the following commands, replacing `<Your Name>` and `<your@email.com>` with your actual information:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
